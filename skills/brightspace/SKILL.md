description: Read Brightspace data through the Brightspace Bar menu-bar app and manage its calendar heatmap. Use only when the user explicitly asks for Brightspace Bar, its menu-bar calendar or heatmap, or the `bsb` CLI. Do not use for generic Brightspace or D2L requests, or when the user asks for the Brightspace MCP or `brightspace-mcp-server`.

# Brightspace Bar for agents

## Routing boundary

This skill is only for the Brightspace Bar app. Do not select it merely because
the user mentions Brightspace, D2L, courses, grades, syllabi, or due dates.

If the user asks for the Brightspace MCP or `brightspace-mcp-server`, use the
available Brightspace MCP tools. If those tools are unavailable, say so. Never
substitute Brightspace Bar or start its MFA flow without the user's explicit
request.

This workflow requires macOS, a configured Brightspace Bar checkout, and Node
22 or newer on `PATH`.

Brightspace Bar is a macOS menu-bar app that shows a student's Brightspace
(D2L) work as a heatmap per course. It is deliberately deterministic: it only
shows what the D2L API reports as work. You are not so limited — you can read
a syllabus — and `bsb` is how you hand what you find to the bar, and how you
read everything the bar can see.

**One rule above all: `bsb` never writes to Brightspace.** Every Brightspace
call is a GET, structurally. The only thing you can write is the student's own
item list in the app. Treat that as their calendar: show them what you intend
to add and get a yes before `bsb add`.

## The command

`scripts/bsb` (next to this file) runs the CLI. It finds the Brightspace Bar
checkout on its own — through the symlink this skill was installed as, or the
path `make setup` recorded — and `./bsb` at the repo root is the same thing.
If it says it cannot find the checkout, ask the user where the repo is and
set `BSB_REPO=/that/path`. Every command takes `--json` for machine output;
use it. Exit codes: `0` done · `1` refused, nothing written · `2` session
expired (see *Session*).

Start every task with:

```sh
scripts/bsb status          # is there a cache? when was it written? how many items?
scripts/bsb courses         # the current courses with their numeric ids
```

Course ids (e.g. `1631476`) are what every other command takes. `--all` lists
past enrollments too.

## Reading

| Need | Command | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| What Brightspace says is due | `bsb work --course ID` | From the cache — assignments, quizzes, gradebook heads-up rows. Check this before adding items so you do not duplicate them. |
| Announcements | `bsb announcements --course ID` | From the cache, newest first. |
| The syllabus | `bsb syllabus --course ID --out DIR` | Prints the course overview text (often the syllabus itself) and downloads every content topic named like a syllabus into `DIR`. Read the files with your document tools (PDF, .docx, .txt). |
| Everything in the course | `bsb content --course ID` | The table of contents: topic ids, File/Link, module path. |
| One file | `bsb fetch --course ID --topic TOPICID --out DIR` | Downloads a File topic under the server's filename. `--stdout` streams it. |
| Course overview | `bsb overview --course ID` | The text alone. |
| Grades | `bsb grades --course ID` | What the student's grades page shows. |
| Anything else | `bsb api le:ID/…` or `bsb api lp:…` | Any read route. See [references/endpoints.md](references/endpoints.md). |

A `.docx` with no converter at hand: `unzip -p FILE.docx word/document.xml | sed 's/<[^>]*>/ /g'`
gives readable text.

## Writing to the bar

Items are `assignment`, `quiz` or `test` (also accepted: `exam`, `midterm`,
`final` → test; `homework`, `hw`, `project` → assignment). Each needs a course
id, a title and a due date. `due` is `YYYY-MM-DD` (23:59 local — Brightspace's
own default), `"YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM"` (local), or an ISO-8601 instant. The link
defaults to the course home.

```sh
scripts/bsb add --course 1631476 --kind test --title "Midterm 1" --due 2026-10-06
```

For more than one, write a JSON array and add it as a whole — validated as a
whole, written as a whole, so one bad row means nothing is written and every
problem is listed:

```sh
scripts/bsb add --batch items.json --json     # or --batch - to read stdin
scripts/bsb items --course 1631476            # what is there now
scripts/bsb remove ID [ID…]                   # undo by id
scripts/bsb remove --course 1631476 --all     # undo a whole import
```

Exact duplicates (same course, kind, title, due) are skipped, so re-running an
import is safe. Items appear in the menu-bar heatmap the moment the file lands
— no relaunch, no click. The contract is in [references/items.md](references/items.md).

## The recipe: put a syllabus on the calendar

1. `bsb courses --json` → pick the course, note its id and end date (the term
   tells you the year for dates written like "Oct 6").
2. `bsb syllabus --course ID --out ./syllabus` → read the overview text and
   the downloaded files.
3. Extract every dated deliverable: homework, projects, quizzes, exams. Decide
   the kind. Resolve relative dates ("Week 5 Friday") against the course's start
   date and say when you guessed.
4. `bsb work --course ID --json` → drop what Brightspace already lists (same
   title and day), so the bar does not show it twice.
5. Write the batch file, print it as a table for the user, and ask for a yes.
6. `bsb add --batch items.json --json` → report what was added and skipped.
7. Tell them how to undo: `bsb remove --course ID --all`.

## Session

Reads from Brightspace need a live session. Exit code `2` with "session is
expired" means it is not. `bsb refresh` runs the app's login ladder; it can put
a verification number on the menu-bar icon that the student must match on
their phone. **Tell the user before running it** and do not run it repeatedly.
The app also refreshes on its own every 30 minutes. Cache-only commands
(`courses`, `work`, `announcements`, `items`, `status`, `add`, `remove`) work
without a session.

## Never

- Never send anything but a GET to Brightspace. `bsb` cannot; do not go around
  it with curl. There is no supported write to the LMS.
- Never read or print `session.json`, `credentials.json` or the `profile/`
  directory under the app's root. They are credentials.
- Never add items without showing the user the list first.
- Never treat `--all` enrollments from past terms as current.
